The Rosenbrock valley is a well known function used to test performance in optimisation algorithms. 

The conjugate gradient method is not compatible with this function, so its nonlinear version must be used https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/466462/minimize-rosenbrock-function-with-conjugate-gradient-method
